## Publishing to Azure App Service
After verifying the ASP.NET Core RESTful Web API is functioning correctly, you can publish it to Azure App Service. 

Follow these steps:
1. [Create an Azure API Management instance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/get-started-create-service-instance): Use the Azure portal to create a new instance, if necessary.
2. [Import and publish your API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/import-and-publish): Import your API and publish it to Azure API Management.
3. [Create and publish a product](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-add-products?tabs=azure-portal&pivots=interactive): Create a product and publish it to Azure API Management.
4. [Authenticate your API and connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/azure-active-directory-authentication): Authenticate your API and connector with Microsoft Entra ID.

By completing these steps, you can successfully publish your ASP.NET Core RESTful Web API to Azure App Service.
