# Project C# ASP.NET Core RESTful Web API
#### Author: Daniel Juarez

## Project Overview
This project provides technical interviewers with a concise overview of core concepts in a CRUD-based C# ASP.NET Core RESTful Web API, built around a basic ticketing system and extended according to defined user stories. It demonstrates practical application of software engineering best practices.

Key features of the project:
- **Dependency Injection**:  Implements Dependency Injection to promote loose coupling and improve testability.
- **API Documentation**: Utilizes Swagger to generate clear, concise documentation and improve the developer experience.
- **Adherence to C# Best Practices**: Follows industry-standard C# coding conventions to ensure readability, maintainability, and scalability.
- **Clean Architecture Principles**: The project is structured according to Clean Architecture to ensure separation of concerns and maintainable, scalable code.
- **Error Handling**: Implements a structured exception hierarchy to enhance fault tolerance and streamline error management.
- **Extension Methods**: Implements extension methods in C# to enhance existing types, promoting code flexibility and scalability.
- **Unit Testing**: Uses MS Unit Test and Moq, with flexibility to integrate other C# testing frameworks, to facilitate TDD and promote comprehensive test coverage.
- **Azure Deployment**: Follows Microsoftâ€™s step-by-step guidance for deploying the project to Azure App Services.

If discussed during an interview, I will be available to explain any of these approaches in detail, discussing the rationale behind the design choices and their benefits in real-world application development.

## Technical Specifications
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition version 17.12.3
- **Framework**: C# 12 with .NET 8 (Long-Term Support)
- **Database**: Uses InMemoryDatabase for portability and demonstration purposes, with the option to replace it with a real database engine
